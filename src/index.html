          <p>
              Developed by the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) at the University of Southern California, formerly the California Civic Engagement Project, this interactive web-based mapping tool is designed to assist Texas elections officials in the state’s 62 most populous counties. CID will soon expand the Siting Tool to all counties in the state.

            <h1>About The Tool</h1>

            <p>
              The Texas Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by identifying optimal voting locations for half-mile grid squares across a county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each of the state’s 62 most populous counties. These local data can be used to inform voter outreach and education efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: For Texas counties with polling places, the Tool sites the number of voting locations in the most recent comparable election publicly disclosed by the county elections office. For counties approved to use the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/countywide-polling-place-program.shtml">Countywide Polling Place Program (CWPP)</a> for the 2020 general election, the Tool sites the number of 2020 general election voting locations publicly disclosed by the county elections office. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites as a baseline, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.
