          <p>
              Developed by the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) at the University of Southern California, formerly the California Civic Engagement Project, this interactive web-based mapping tool is designed to assist Texas elections officials in the state’s 62 most populous counties.

            <h1>About The Tool</h1>

            <p>
                The Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by producing optimal voting locations for half-mile grid squares across a county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each of the state's 62 counties. The Voting Location Siting Tool is being rolled out in Texas in two phases in August and September of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first phase, CID will be releasing multiple types of community-level demographic and voter data, each viewable in separate interactive maps. Communities can immediately begin using these data to start identifying voting locations or to organize voter outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              In phase two, additional data modeling by CID will bring together all the voting and demographic data into one single interactive layered map, which can then be used by communities to further identify placement of local optimized voting locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, Harris County  is in phase two, providing full data modeling. The rest of Texas’s most populous counties are in phase one. For these counties, the Siting Tool provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each county. Phase Two for these counties is coming soon.
            </p>

                Note: The Tool sites the legally required number of voting locations in a county as a minimum baseline. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.
